## Dealing With Conflict
When I think of conflict in my life, conflict that I was directly involved with, I often struggle to find a good example. I’m rather prone to avoiding conflict as much as possible. Sometimes is an awful approach to life, sometimes it makes things a heck of a lot easier.
However, there is a particularly salient example that comes to mind. Housing in college can one of the more difficult situations to figure out. Everyone wants to live with friends, but the venn diagram of your friends doesn’t necessarily overlap as much as you think.
It was junior year and my close friend (Jeremy) invited a friend of his (Will, an acquaintance of mine) to live with us for our senior year. Will would be a 5th roommate in a suite made for 4 people, two double rooms plus a common area. This wasn’t the problem. The problem was Jeremy insisted that he and another member of our suite would share a double, forcing me to be the stuffed-triple room with someone I barely knew. I didn’t see how this was quote-unquote fair. Perhaps I was being overly picky or stuck up, but I refused this arrangement. I saw it as Jeremy’s responsibility to live with the person he brought into our group. Jeremy did not see it this way. So we argued about it. The argument got heated and mean. Then for the first time that I could remember, like high schoolers, we weren’t talking to one another.
Ultimately, after cooling off, I apologized and we moved on. When senior year began I was expecting to be in that triple room, but Jeremy, without telling me, changed the arrangement to how I envisioned it.
I don’t know if we ever spoke about it, but I appreciated this immensely.
It think that our conflict came from an inability to see the other’s point of view. Which is a pretty common source of conflict, if not (in some way) the sole source.
Looking back, I realize that I handled this conflict poorly, in fact we both did. We met and spoke under the pretense of civil discussion, but all we said to one another was barbed and angry. We ticked one another off to the point that communication completely broke down and no progress was being made.
If I can be proud of anything during that time, it was that I was able to swallow pride and apologize, and that I think our friendship actually became stronger because of it.
If I could go back, I would try to approach our conversations calmly, and without the anger. Anger never improves communication. Anger does not engender empathy, it can actually disable it. I don’t know if we could have reached the agreement I wanted, or at all. But I would work to make sure that the argument didn’t reach the point it did.
I learned the importance of a sincere apology. Without it we might not have been able to patch up our friendship as well as we did. It could have been a burr in the side, something moved on from, but never forgotten.
