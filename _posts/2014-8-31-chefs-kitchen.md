## Kitchen vs Table

The kitchen vs restaurant is a brilliant analogy. One I wish I knew a long time ago so I could have applied it to college. The idea that we're all contributing to one big, on going experiment is equal parts exciting and terrifying. The comfort of the restaurant comes from trusting the cooks know what they're doing. The fear of the kitchen is letting the souffle collapse. Order a souffle at a restaurant, it's tasty. Successfully make one yourself - it's tasty and an accomplishment. It sounds like a high-risk, high-reward scenario to me.
Shereef's point about extroverts being energized by social interactions, and introverts being drained set off alarm bells for me. I'm definitely an introvert. I think that engaging with the culture of DBC, while I'm definitley tenancious and a pretty good problem solver, cold be difficult for me because of its focus on social coding. I consider myself an empathetic person, and DBC's approach to engineering empathy is very attractive, but I'm recognizing that it will take an extra amount of effort from me to get the most out of it.
I am both nervous and eager to get to DBC's on site portion. My feelings oscillate between the two several times a day. Either way, I'm ready to work the hardest I ever have and learn everything I can learn.
