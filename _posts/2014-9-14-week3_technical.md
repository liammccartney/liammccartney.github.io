## JavaScript: Pros and Cons
Called ‘the language of the web’ JavaScript is ubiquitous across the internet. And with good reason. JavaScript is a robust language that is simple to learn. It was created for Netscape’s Navigator browser to allow for dynamic front-end development. It was designed to have syntax similar to Java and C++, which made it easy to pick up.

JavaScript is flexible, it can be used like a procedural language, but also provides functionality to be object oriented. JavaScript is fast, it is processed on the client side, freeing up the server for other tasks. Today every single web browser supports JavaScript, making it the number one choice for front-end development. JavaScript also has a tremendous open source community, which means that as a developer you have a wealth of knowledge to tap at any moment. There are countless tools and libraries such as AJAX and jQuery which make up for any of JavaScript’s limitations.

That’s right, despite all its power and use, JavaScript is not without limitations. JavaScript is not particularly secure, due to the fact that it is executed on the client side. Because of this many users disable JavaScript which means that your webpage will not display correctly for everyone. Even if they don’t disable it, every browser renders JavaScript differently. You can’t win! JavaScript cannot access databases, and it cannot write files to the server. This is why developers created tools Ajax. Sometimes JavaScript’s flexibility can be a difficulty, such as type coercion. When two values of different types are operated on JavaScript with change the type of one of them to match the other, which means you don’t get an error telling you of your mistake, you just get a result you don’t expect.

All in all JavaScript is here to stay, so its limitations are ones that developers have found ways to overcome or avoid.
