## Problems in the Tech World
From net neutrality to quantum computing there is a whole host of challenges facing the tech industry today. But before any of these there is the issue of gender diversity within the industry itself. More specifically a problem with misogyny and sexism.
Despite initially being associated with women, the world of computers and programming has become a boys club. One that disparages the notion of a woman joining the ranks.
The statistics are staggering. Only about 25% of all IT jobs are held by women, and 56% of those women leave before mid-career. These resignations have become more prominent in the last few years. [Julie Ann Horvath](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/) left GitHub earlier this year after enduring a sexist internal culture at the company. [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/technology/technologys-man-problem.html?_r=0) wrote on the problem back in April with a report on Elissa Shevinsky’s trouble with her business partner at the startup Glimpse.
These women are two prominent examples of a pervasive problem. A very current and salient example is the Gamergate movement. A loose group of mostly young white male gamers who perpetuate a culture of misogyny, cruelty, and terrorism under the guise of crusading for journalistic ethics.
When asked why there aren’t more women in the industry most tech companies are reported as shifting blame onto schools, student advisors. That women are discouraged by administrators from taking math and science courses - which very may well be true, but it is also a cop out of a response.
We seem to be at a very crucial point in the fight against sexism. The cases are growing more prominent and the supporters are becoming more voluble.
I cannot truly offer any ideas of solutions. Unfortunately this problem is enormous, and it extends far beyond the tech industry. But I am confident that progress is being made, even if it doesn’t always look like it.
