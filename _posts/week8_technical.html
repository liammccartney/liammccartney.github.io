        <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2><p>Ruby on Rails is an open sourced web application framework.</p>
        <p>Ok. What does that mean?</p>
        <p>A web application framework is like a skeleton of code designed to make the development of web applications easier and faster to do.</p>
        <p>Ruby on Rails is one such framework that relies on the Ruby language.</p>
        <h4>Some History</h4><p>Ruby of Rails (RoR) came out of a web application built by David Heinemeier Hansson (known as DHH in the RoR community) in 2003. That web app was 37signals’ Basecamp. DHH lifted the skeleton of that application and made it available to the open source community in 2004.</p>
        <h4>Why Use a Framework?</h4><p>Frameworks simplify the process of developing an application. A framework is defined as a set of code libraries and data structures that provide basic functionality which can be used, eliminated, or specialized. In short, a framework works out of the box. It’s up to you to make it what you want it to be. It’s like getting a Lego set already built, but with a box of extra pieces to really make it yours.</p>
        <h4>Why Use RoR?</h4><p>Well, because Ruby rocks! Ruby is possibly one of the simplest, and easiest to use languages out there.</p>
        <p>Aside from that RoR was built on two primary pillars.</p>
        <p>1) DRY Code</p>
        <ul><li><ul><li>Don’t Repeat Yourself<ul><li>Write your code in discrete, reusable chunks</li></ul>
        </li><li>DRY code is easier to maintain</li><li>Decreases the likelihood of mistakes, and those mistakes propagating through the whole application</li></ul></li></ul>
        <p>2) Convention over Configuration</p>
        <ul><li><ul><li>This is a ‘design paradigm that seeks to decrease the number of decisions made by developers’<ul><li>It encourages simplicity, but not at the expense of flexibility</li></ul>
        </li><li>This means that RoR comes with ‘sensible defaults’ - behaviors that make sense and you’ll want to capitalize upon.</li><li>These are behaviors you can use, delete, or rework as you see fit.</li><li>This speeds up development.</li><li>Less code to maintain</li><li>And you can trust that these functionalities follow best practices.</li></ul></li></ul>
