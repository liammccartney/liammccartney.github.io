        <p>You’re stuck on your code. Majorly, completely, bafflingly stuck. You need a solution, and answer to you problem.</p>

        <p>Well, the best way to get a good answer for your problem is to ask a good question.</p>

        <p>But a question is a question is a question, right?</p>

        <p>Well, not really. Certainly not in the realm of internet forums.</p>

        <p>No, you need to learn how to ask a good question, which isn’t always easy. A good question balances context with brevity. You need to give your potential savior just enough information that they can completely understand your situation, but also not too much that they get bogged down in unnecessary details. This balancing act, depending on the question, can be a whole problem in its own right.</p>

        <p>Let’s take for example a question I asked a friend of mine as I was starting DBC Phase 0. Like many of my fellow cohort mates I was really thrown by Git. Of all the new things I’ve learned, Git was the most foreign (and to this day it still retains much of is mysteriousness). I called up a friend who had just graduated from a Code Bootcamp in Boston to ask him a few questions.</p>

        <p>“I don’t get Git!” I said.</p>

        <p>And he didn’t know where to start. </p>

        <p>My question was too broad, I hadn’t done enough of my own research, and I (unfairly) expected him to teach me. Over the course of about twenty minutes he was able to work with me to narrow down where my confusion was. Being the patient friend he is he asked me questions that I had to answer to find out what I needed to know.</p>

        <p>When phrasing a question that’s an important step. Ask yourself your question, pretend you’re hearing it fresh. Does it make sense? Is there enough background information? Can someone understand where you are and provide you help if this is the only thing they know about you and your project? Rework your question until these questions are satisfied.</p>

        <p>Help others help you. Know what you don’t need to know, this way no one’s time will get wasted. Developing a good question is a process.</p>

        <p>Clarity, context, and brevity are all key.</p>
