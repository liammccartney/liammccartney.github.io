    <h3>How I Think And What To Do About It</h3>
    <p>I have to admit, I usually find theories such as Gregorc's Mind Styles, or the Myers Briggs Personalities, to be wanting, as though they are just a few steps removed from astrology. However once I got over my initial doubts about the Gregorc Mind Styles theory, I found the concept compelling and useful. I took the test, and my results were clear: I sit firmly on the abstract end of the perception ability. With an almost even split between Abstract Sequential (AS) and Abstract Random (AR), slightly favoring AR.</p>

    <p>While I was researching what these two styles are like I found myself constantly nodding or chuckling, because they described my mind almost perfectly. I am often frustrated with the randomness of my brain, and my difficulty with focus. According to what I have read and AR mind's approach can seem like ADD. They take in the big picture and then their attention jumps around to whatever is most interesting. I have wondered for years if I might have ADD, and while I have no idea if I do or not, knowing that this might just be an aspect of my thinking style is comforting.</p>
    <p>In Phase 0 the biggest difficulty for me has been time management. I actually have an over abundance of time. It's how I use it, how I focus during that time, that I struggle with. I think that my AR and AS mind styles actually combat one another. My AR mind likes to jump from topic to topic at whim. At the first wiff of boredom it will seek out new material. Which directly contrasts with an AS desire to read everything, and process it all in careful order. Sometimes when my AS inclination forces my brain to sit still for a minute, my AR disposition tells me I'm losing interest, which can diminish my drive to complete my work, and shakes my focus.</p>
    <p>Understanding that my focus struggles are an aspect of these two mindsets means that I can start to work with this difficulty. I think that rather than tabbing over to facebook when I lose the thread of my focus, I can keep open articles, books, blogs, whatever about web development. That way when I feel the urge to tab over to something new, I can use that urge to learn something new, whether it's technical or cultural. I can maintain the topic, even if my focus is shifting.</p>
    <p>As I write this I realize that this is where the growth mindset helps tremendously. Iâ€™m not locked into either of these methods. I can dip in and out as needed. I can develop the better inclinations of both and apply them together as appropriate.</p>
