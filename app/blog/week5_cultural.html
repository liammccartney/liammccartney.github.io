    <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
    <p>I was initially very skeptical of pair programming. I never really enjoyed group work in school, and that was usually with people that I knew well. The idea that I would have to work with people I had never met before on material that I am only just learning was stressful. So I am happy to report that pairing has been nothing by enjoyable so far. Everyone in the program I have met has been absolutely kind and easy to work with, not to mention really bright. I didn’t expect to appreciate pairing as much as I do.</p>
    <p>Every session I learn something new from my pair. And sometimes I am even able to teach them something new. This exchange of knowledge is what I find most rewarding about the process of pairing. We are all learning, reading, and researching together, so pairing gives us an opportunity to share all our hard work so we can all benefit together.</p>
    <p>It is also nice to share the feeling of the victory of a successful solution with someone else.</p>
    <p>The only frustration that I have encountered so far is with the pace of pairing. I have a tendency to leap into a challenge and figure things out on the fly. This is often not the best way to work. A few times while pairing I have had to slow down my own pace to match my pair’s. At first I struggled with this, feeling constrained. But I am beginning to learn the value of moving slower. Slow isn’t actually the correct word, methodically is better. The times that my pair and I have truly worked through the challenge methodically, defining the problem, pseudo coding, breaking the solution into easily implementable parts, we have encountered less errors than my fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach. Ultimately we are saving ourselves headaches and frustration. I am learning to appreciate this approach and use it on my own.</p>
    <p>Feedback was scary at first, but as I said earlier, everyone has been tremendously kind, so feedback has actually become something I look forward to. The most common piece of feedback that I receive is that I am no quick enough to voice my own ideas, specifically when I am driving. I think that this comes from my own tendency to doubt that my approach could be a better one than the one my pair is suggesting. A few times it has been, but not always. So I’ll hold back on my thoughts until we run into a problem. If I am faster at just voicing my idea then at least we have more than one option, and we can evaluate which one will be better for the challenge at hand.</p>
    <p>Writing feedback can be difficult, at least when it comes to actionable feedback. It’s not difficult to be kind, because everyone is awesome and deserves praise. But sometimes I struggle with finding something to talk about that can help them. The more I pair, the more opportunities I see, so I think pairing and feedback require practice, just like coding. </p>
