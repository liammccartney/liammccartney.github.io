    <h2>Stereotype Threats</h2>
    <p>I think that my first interaction with this concept was through Malcolm Gladwell's writing.<a href="http://gladwell.com/the-art-of-failure/">He explains it well here</a></p>
    <p>A stereotype threat is when a person performs at a level below their actual ability because of pressure or fear of fulfilling a negative stereotype about themselves. The the term was coined by Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson in 1995. They had conducted a study asking Stanford students to take a test that was present as either a “standardized” test or just an “abstract laboratory tool”. The study found that when the test was perceived as “standardized” the black students performed worse than the white students. When the test wasn’t described as “standardized” the scores between the two groups were basically identical.</p>
    <p>There is a perceived stereotype that black students do not do as well on standardized tests as white students. The threat of confirming this stereotype is so great that it can actually affect the performance of a black student.</p>
    <p>This is sort of remarkable, and completely depressing.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years I feel like I have been being educated in the privileges of my life. I always knew that I was, on the whole, a very lucky person. I have a stable home, a loving family, a great education, and I have never truly wanted for anything. I am white, I am straight, and I am male.</p>
    <p>In this world, so filled with a myriad of ways to oppress others, to be like me is almost like being exempt from oppression.</p>
    <p>So, because of that, I cannot say that I have ever felt as though I was under a stereotype threat.</p>
    <p>Coming from an Irish background, I can be expected to be pugnacious and a drunkard. Neither are true. But this is comedic when you consider Steel and Aronson’s results from that study.</p>
    <p>I can really only work on becoming more aware of this phenomenon. Research more possible examples, and encourage myself to consider them on a daily basis. I hope that I will be able to recognize the threat of a stereotype in another person. It would be a difficult topic to broach, but I would encourage the person to consider their abilities on their own merits. A person needs to be measured on their own actions, nothing more.</p>
