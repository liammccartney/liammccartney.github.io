    <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h2>
    <h4>Compassion</h4>
    <p>I chose compassion as my first value because I believe that it is fundamental to most other values. Being compassionate and empathetic ensures that you can work with others in a kind and harmonious fashion.</p>
    <h4>Loyalty</h4>
    <p>I find loyalty to be an immensely important value in myself and in my closest friends. To know that someone is loyal is to be able to rely on them and to trust them implicitly. It can be hard to find, but essential to the best relationships.</p>
    <p>I try to live up to these values every day of my life. Together they form a sort of feedback loop. A desire to be compassionate can feed your sense of loyalty, and vice versa. Neither are easy, and I often fail at adhering to them. But on the days that I do succeed I feel accomplished.</p>
    <p>My values make me feel a little idealistic and perhaps a little naive. But that’s what makes them worth striving for, I think. Values should be a little idealistic, because if you’re not aiming for the ideal, then what are you doing?</p>
    <p>If I ever do feel stereotype threat, I hope that I would feel able to reach out to the people in my life I find the most compassionate and loyal to help me see my way clear.</p>
    <h4>Staying Well</h4>
    <p>I love to run. Running clears my head, gives me time to reflect, gives me an injection of endorphins, and just puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day. I wish I had better discipline! I’m not very consistent with my running. I occasionally get on a good routine, and it dramatically improves my days. You would think that would encourage me to keep at it. Unfortunately my laziness in the mornings wins out more often that my drive to exercise.</p>
    <p>I’ve also started to meditate occasionally. I find the experience incredibly rewarding. A few times I have been able to recognize stress and anxiety and I have been able to cut them off by a quick meditation. I hope to keep up with this practice while I am at DBC.</p>
