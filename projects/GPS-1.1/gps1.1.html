      <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
      <p>Pair programming is a style of coding in which two people are coding together, either in the same room, or remotely. Typically one person is directing the other person, while the other person actually codes the page. This is called driver/navigator pairing. Other types of pairing styles exist, but driver/navigator is the type of pairing supported at Dev Bootcamp.</p>
      <h2>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h2>
      <p>DBC emphasizes skills, but communication skills as well. DBC believes pair programming is a great way to build your communication skills in preparation for your life as a professional programmer.</p>
      <h2>Driver vs Navigator</h2>
      <p>In pairing situations where there are two people one person will be designated as the driver, this person doing the actual coding on the page. The other person, the navigator, directs the driver and tells them what to code. Usually drivers and navigators will switch roles in the middle of the session.</p>
