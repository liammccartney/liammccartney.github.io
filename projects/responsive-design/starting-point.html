  <div class="reflection">
    This was a fun, but pretty difficult challenge. I didn't feel like I had done enough messing around with responsive design before hand. One of my biggest challenges was probably the simplest to figure out. Before my pairing session I decided to try out a couple of media queries to see if I understood the concept. I couldn't get it to work. After probably more than an hour of bashing my head into a wall I realized that I was writing my media query at the top of the CSS sheet, rather than the bottom. By that time it was time to pair up. Working together went smoothly and the responsive design came together pretty quickly.
